Plan:

1. Talk about web aesthetics
- Index Event Section
	- Slideshow

2. Subfeatures
3. Code Convention
- SASS
- Prettier if indentation probs
- dashed file names
- exported functions are Pascal Cased according to filename
- CSS files must be placed next to JS files
- each page must have their own folder of components
- each page folder must have one subcomponents folder for components to be used within components
- Placeholder images shall be placed in Static
- There shall be an assets folder for each page in static
- Asset files that will be replaced directly by the webmaster shall be named according to the order they will appear on the page they are in
Considerations:
- Place JSON files in static
- Place dynamically edited data in static
4. Begin work

RE: color scheme
- Stick NEAR the designated website colors

Todo:

- Install Prettier IF MAY PROBLEMA SA TABULATION
